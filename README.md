# javaFileSync
Java file sync

# How to use
Go to build directory and run the jar. It will automatically create a new configuration file "javaFileSync.conf" where you can choose the two directories to sync. Remember to use slashes instead backslashed on Windows too.

# How to edit
Open the directory with Eclipse as a normal project. Then add to the buildpath the file "java-json.jar" which is into the folder "libraries"

Tested and working with JRE 1.8.0
